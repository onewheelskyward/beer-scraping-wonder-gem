Migrate the parser code into gems, that parse the html upon command and return the standardized object (document this, perhaps via jsonschema?)

Create an NLP-enabled bot that can handle conversations such as:

user> Beerbot, I'd like a nice IPA.

Beerbot> How about the Notorious IIIPA at Bailey's?

user> Perhaps something a little less strong.

Beerbot> Cold, Cheap at Apex might be the one for you.

user> That's a little too lowball.  Have anything slightly better?

Beerbot> Loyal Legion just tapped Gigantic's IPA.

user> Perfect!

Don't forget to train using...what, beer advocate for notes?  Interesting thought.
